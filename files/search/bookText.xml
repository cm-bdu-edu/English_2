                   The  "Supplementary  Books"  series  has  been  compiled  to  help

            learners overcome common obstacles in learning English and make the
            process  more  efficient  and  achievable.  The  series  consists  of five
            workbooks,  designed  for  primary  students  from  levels  1  to  5,  aimed  at
            reinforcing classroom knowledge and assisting in exam preparation.

                   The  level  2 workbook  includes  16  learning  units  organized  around

            four main tasks:

                   Part 1: VOCABULARY

                   Help build a strong lexical foundation. Through consistent practice,

            learners  can  memorize  and  apply  words  in  various  contexts,  preparing
            them for advanced language use.

                   Part 2: LISTENING

                   Offer  interactive  listening  exercises  to enhance  understanding  of
            spoken language in different situations, preparing learners for real-world

            conversations and interactions.

                   Part 3: READING AND WRITING

                   Strengthen  reading  fluency, comprehension,  and  writing  skills.  This

            section  allows  learners  to express  their  thoughts  in writing  and  improve
            their ability to form coherent sentences.

                   Part 4: SPEAKING

                   Feature  interactive  speaking  exercises  that  foster  pronunciation,
            sentence structure, and spontaneous conversation, making speaking a

          Lưu hành nội bộ
            fun and essential part of language learning.
                   The authors  hope  this  book  will  serve as  a valuable  resource  for
            learners  on  their  journey  to  mastering  English,  while  also  welcoming
            feedback for further improvement in future editions.]]></page><page Index="4"><![CDATA[TABLE OF CONTENTS
